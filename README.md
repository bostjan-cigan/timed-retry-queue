This is an easy utility for processing tasks in a sequential order with a number of retries (time based) before failing or returning the result.

## Getting started

First install the package.

```bash
yarn add @kijuub/timed-retry-queue
npm install @kijuub/timed-retry-queue
```

## Usage

By default the queue tasks are processed in FIFO order.

First you need to create the *TimedRetryQueue* object. There are some optional parameters that you can override while creating the constructor:

```javascript
import { TimedRetryQueue } from @kijuub/timed-retry-queue

const options: TimedRetryQueueOptions = {
    default_retries: 8
} 
const executer = new TimedRetryQueue( options )
```

The parameter *default_retries* overrides the default number of retries for a failed task that does not have the retries options specified. By default this is set to 1.

### Adding retrying tasks

To add tasks to the process method, you need to create the *TimedRetryQueueTasks* object.

```javascript
import { TimedRetryQueue, TimedRetryQueueTasks } from @kijuub/timed-retry-queue

const executer = new TimedRetryQueue()

const queue = new TimedRetryQueueTasks()

queue.add( {
    task: ( arg1 ) => {
        console.log( `The first argument is: ${ arg1 }` )
        return true
    },
    args: [ "Just pass me in!" ],
    parameters: {
    	retries: 2,
    	interval: "2s"
    }
} )

queue.addMany(
    [
        {
            task: () => {
                return true
            }
        },
        {
            task: () => {
                return false
            }
        }
    ]
)

const process = await executer.process( queue )
```

The *process* method on the *executer* accepts the queue and processes the queue in FIFO order.

When adding a task the following options are supported:

```javascript
{
	"task": <function>,
	"args": <array>,
	"parameters": {
		"retries": <number>,
		"interval": <string>
	}
}
```

The *task* parameter is the function that needs to be executed, the *arguments* parameters are the arguments that are used for the function call.

The *parameters* object allows you to define how many *retries* to do before failing, the *interval* sets how much time between retries. This options supports timestring based values (e.g. 1s, 2 seconds, 2m etc.).

**NOTE:** The task is deemed failed if an error is thrown.

The *TimedRetryQueueTasks* also supports the following methods:

```javascript
add( task: TimedRetryQueueTask ): void,
addMany( tasks: Array<TimedRetryQueueTask> ): void
isEmpty(): boolean
getNext(): TimedRetryQueueTask | undefined
empty(): void,
size(): number
```

They respectively:

* Add a single task
* Add multiple tasks
* Check if the process queue is empty
* Fetch the next task
* Empty the task queue
* Return the current size of the task queue

### Adding non-retrying tasks

You can also execute tasks that do not need to be repeated by not passing any parameters (this is only default behaviour if you do not override the default retries value):

```javascript
import { TimedRetryQueue, TimedRetryQueueTask } from @kijuub/timed-retry-queue

const taskOne = () => {
	return true
}

const taskTwo = () => {
	return false
}

const tasks: Array<TimedRetryQueueTask> = [
        {
            task: taskOne
        },
        {
            task: taskTwo
    }
]

const timedQueue = new TimedRetryQueue( tasks )
const results = await timedQueue.process()
```

### Custom queue

By default the queue is processed in a FIFO order. If you would like to implement it differently you can implement your own *TimedRetryQueueTasks* by implementing the exported *ITimedRetryQueueTasks* interface.

```javascript
interface ITimedRetryQueueTasks {
	add( task: TimedRetryQueueTask ): void,
	addMany( tasks: Array<TimedRetryQueueTask> ): void
	isEmpty(): boolean
	getNext(): TimedRetryQueueTask | undefined
	empty(): void,
	size(): number
}
```
